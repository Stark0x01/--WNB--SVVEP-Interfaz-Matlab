# SVVEP-Interfaz-Matlab
SSVEP interface developed in Matlab, based on Psychtoolbox 

This project, develops a sum game where the user has to focuse in the right answer. 
It uses the Psychtoolbox for the generation of the stimuli in 10hz and 15hz.

This project is based on tutorials from Dr Peter Scarfe (http://peterscarfe.com/ptbtutorials.html), Keith Schneider "Matlab and Psychophysics Toolbox Seminar" and Farhan Baluch presentation in the Neuroimaging workshop

There is three Matlab scripts, where "interfaz_pstoolbox.m" is the sum game with SSVEP stimuli and  "interfaz_pstoolbox_10hz.m", "interfaz_pstoolbox_15hz.m" shows a centered stimuli flickering at 10hz or 15hz respectively.
